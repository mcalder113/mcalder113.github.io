# Good news everyone...

I am very pleased to announce I was accepted to join as a member on the Technology and Telecommunication Commission. I've lived in Skokie for the last 8+ years with my family and I love it here. I look forward to lending whatever aid and expertise pertaining to telecommunications and broader technology issues affecting the Skokie community.
